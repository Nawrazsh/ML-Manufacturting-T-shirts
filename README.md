# ML-Manufacturting-T-shirts
A clothes manufacturing Company want to optimize their T-shirt line production sizes to fit different sizes of customers. The objective is to group all the different collected sizes into k clusters (groups)
# Data collection 
a sample of 100,000 persons was chosen to collect measurements of their Height, weight, body mass index, length between the shoulders and length of the arms .
# Clustering 
K-mean clustering algorithm has been used to cluster the normalized 100,000 sample into K clusters. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the features from 5D to 2D asthe features found to be reduced and still preserve the same information.
# running the code
when running main.py , entering the k value which for example can be 5 --> 5 cluster are to be prduced
